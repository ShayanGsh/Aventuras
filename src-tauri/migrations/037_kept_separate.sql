-- Pairs of entities the user has declared to be different subjects.

-- The duplicate detector is deliberately lenient: it groups "Kael" with "Baron Kaelen" so
-- a human can decide. Without a memory of that decision it re-asks every time the window
-- is opened, which makes the second visit useless.
--
-- Keyed by normalized *name pair*, not by entity id, so a later rename or merge cannot
-- resurrect a decision that was already made. Stored per pair rather than per group
-- because grouping is transitive: a group of three can reappear as a group of two.
--
-- `branch_id` is NOT NULL with '' for the main branch, rather than nullable. SQLite's
-- PRIMARY KEY does not reject NULL on a rowid table -- a legacy quirk it keeps for
-- compatibility -- so a nullable column here is a key that never conflicts, and the
-- `INSERT OR IGNORE` that is supposed to make a repeated dismissal a no-op appends a row
-- every time instead. Main-branch stories are the common case, so that is most of them.
