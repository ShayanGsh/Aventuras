/**
 * Settings Migrations
 *
 * Reshaping settings that were persisted by an older version of the app, on the way from
 * disk into the store.
 *
 * Kept out of `settings.svelte.ts` so it can be tested: that file is a rune-based store,
 * and the test runner deliberately omits the Svelte plugin (see `vitest.config.ts`), so
 * nothing in it can be imported by a test. Migrations are the worst possible thing to leave
 * untested -- they run once, unattended, over data the user cannot get back.
 *
 * Written against the *shape* each migration reads rather than the full settings
 * interfaces, so this module does not import the store it feeds. Generic in the merged
 * settings object, so callers get their own type back rather than a widened one.
 *
 * Two properties every migration here has to hold:
 *
 * - **Idempotent.** Nothing removes the legacy keys from the stored blob, so these run on
 *   every load, not just the first one after an upgrade. A migration that keeps firing
 *   after the user has since changed the new setting silently reverts them.
 * - **Silent about untouched values.** A stored value equal to the old default was never a
 *   choice; carrying it across would pin everyone who never opened the panel to a number
 *   that is no longer the default.
