/**
 * Entry Retrieval Service for Aventura
 * Per design doc section 3.2.3: Tiered Injection
 *
 * Implements three tiers of entry injection for lorebook entries:
 * - Tier 1: Always inject (injection.mode === 'always', or state-based like isPresent)
 * - Tier 2: Keyword matching (match name/aliases/keywords against user input & recent story)
 * - Tier 3: LLM selection (shared with `WorldStateInjector` via `./tier3Selection.ts`),
 *   on a different trigger: "how much leftover is too much to just include" is a question
 *   about words here and about record count in the injector, whose candidates are one
 *   line each. Neither drops a leftover on the floor.
 *
 * Selects from authored Lorebook `Entry[]` records only. The live-tracked
 * `Character`/`Location`/`Item`/`StoryBeat` state is `WorldStateInjector`'s job and is
 * not duplicated here -- this service used to synthesize `live-*` pseudo-entries for it,
 * which put the same entities in the prompt twice.
 *
 * Runs on every narrator turn, in every Memory Retrieval mode. It used to be skipped in
 * Agentic mode, where the agent selected entries with its own `select_entry` tool and a
 * fallback caught the case where it delivered nothing. That tool is gone: the agent reads
 * lore to reason about chapters but returns none, so entry selection has one owner and
 * there is nothing to skip or fall back to. Sharing `tier3Selection.ts` with
 * `WorldStateInjector` is code reuse, not a shared responsibility.
