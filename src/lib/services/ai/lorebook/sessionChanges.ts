/**
 * What an approved lore change does to the lorebook, while the session is still running.
 *
 * The agent addresses entries by **index**, and the array it indexes into grows: a create
 * or a merge appends, so `list_entries` hands back indices past the end of the entry list
 * the session started with. This module owns the mapping from index to "what writing it
 * back means", so a change to an entry created mid-session lands instead of being dropped
 * after the tool has already answered `success: true`.
 *
 * Changes are applied as they are made, not replayed at the end: the array the tools read
 * is the array this mutates, so an entry created on step 2 is visible on step 3.
 *
 * Plain TypeScript with no store or SDK imports, so it is testable on its own.
