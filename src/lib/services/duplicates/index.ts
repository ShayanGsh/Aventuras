 * need it and neither should import the other's barrel — `ai/lorebook`'s pulls in the SDK
 * and, through it, a rune store, which no plain module can be imported alongside.
 *
 * The name comparison lives in `./names`. The **world state** had no detector at all and is
 * where duplicates accumulate: the classifier mints a new `Character` whenever the story
 * calls someone by a different title, which on a measured save left thirty-eight rows for
 * about thirty-one people. Some of that is now fixed at the source (see
 * `ClassifierService.formatExistingCharacters`); this is for the rest, and for the rows
 * already written. Only the user can say whether two of them are one person.
 *
 * **A dismissal is remembered**, or the same groups come back every time the window is
 * opened — see `keptSeparateKey`.
 *
 * Plain TypeScript: no store, no database, no SDK.
